        <h1 class="bjs">The Birth of Jesus</h1>
        <p class="bjs">The Angel Gabriel Foretells the Birth of Jesus
            Mary, a young teenager, was living in the village of Nazareth and engaged to be married to Joseph, a Jewish carpenter. One day God sent the angel Gabriel to visit Mary. The angel told Mary that she would conceive a son by the power of the Holy Spirit. She would give birth to this child and name him Jesus.
            
            At first, Mary was afraid and troubled by the angel's words. Being a virgin, Mary questioned the angel, "How can this happen?"
            
            The angel explained that the child would be God's own Son and that nothing was impossible with God. Humbled and in awe, Mary believed the angel of the Lord and rejoiced in God her Savior.
            
            Surely Mary reflected with wonder on the words of Isaiah 7:14:
            
            "Therefore the Lord himself will give you a sign: The virgin will be with child and will give birth to a son, and will call him Immanuel." (NIV)
            The Angel Visits Joseph
            Just as the angel had said, while Mary was engaged to Joseph, she miraculously became pregnant. When she told Joseph, he most likely felt disgraced. He knew the child was not his own, and Mary's apparent unfaithfulness would have carried a grave social stigma. Under Jewish law, Joseph not only had the right to divorce Mary, but he could also have had her put to death by stoning.
            
            But Joseph was a good-hearted man. Although his initial reaction was to break the engagement, the appropriate thing for a righteous man to do, he treated Mary with extreme kindness. He did not want to cause her further shame and decided to act quietly.
            
            Then God sent an angel to Joseph in a dream to confirm that Mary's story was true. She had indeed conceived a child by the power of the Holy Spirit. The angel reassured Joseph, telling him to take Mary as his wife, raise the boy as his own son, and name him Jesus because he would be a Savior to his people.
            
            When Joseph woke from his dream, he willingly obeyed God and married Mary in spite of the public humiliation he would face. Joseph's noble character was one reason God chose him to be Messiah's earthly father.
            
            The Birth of Jesus
            At that time, Caesar Augustus decreed that a census would be taken. Every person in the Roman world had to return to his or her hometown to register. Joseph, being of the line of King David, was required to go to Bethlehem to register with Mary.
            
            The city of Bethlehem was a small village about five miles southwest of Jerusalem. While in Bethlehem, the baby Jesus was born. Because of the census, the inn was overcrowded, and Mary gave birth in a crude stable. She wrapped the baby snuggly in strips of cloth and placed him in a manger (an open box or trough used to feed cattle or other livestock).
            
            Shepherds Worship the Savior
            That night in a nearby field, an angel of the Lord appeared to shepherds who were tending their flocks of sheep. The radiance of God's glory surrounded the angel as it announced that the Savior of the world had been born in the town of David.
            
            The men were terrified, but the angel reassured them, "Do not be afraid. I bring you good news that will cause great joy for all the people. Today in the town of David a Savior has been born to you; he is the Messiah, the Lord" (Luke 2:10–11).
            
            Suddenly a great crowd of heavenly beings appeared with the angel and began singing praises to God: "Glory to God in the highest heaven, and on earth peace to those on whom his favor rests" (Luke 2:14).
            
            As the angelic beings departed, the shepherds said to each other, "Let’s go to Bethlehem! Let’s see the Christ-child!"
            
            They hurried to the village and found Mary, Joseph, and the baby. The shepherds shared with everyone what the angel had said about the newborn Messiah. Then they went on their way praising and glorifying God.
            
            But Mary kept quiet, treasuring their words in her heart.
            
            The Magi Bring Gifts
            Jesus' birth took place when Herod was king of Judea. At this time, wise men (Magi) from the east saw a great star. They followed it, knowing the star signified the birth of the king of the Jews.
            
            The wise men came to the Jewish rulers in Jerusalem and asked where Christ was to be born. The rulers explained, "In Bethlehem in Judea," referring to Micah 5:2. Herod secretly met with the Magi and asked them to report back after they found the child. Herod told the Magi that he wanted to worship the babe. But secretly Herod was plotting to kill the child.
            
            The wise men continued to follow the star in search of the newborn king. They found Jesus with his mother in Bethlehem.
            
            The Magi bowed and worshiped him, offering treasures of gold, frankincense, and myrrh. When they departed, they did not return to Herod. They had been warned in a dream of his plot to destroy the child.</p>
